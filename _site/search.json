I use R for my work and many of the posts here will use R, but my area of interest and expertise lies in data-based web applications. By which I mean, web apps that have the primary use of analysing, visualising, or accessibilising (?) data.\nIn my current day job I primarily do this using R Shiny (which I am a big fan and proponent of), but I also use Python-based frameworks like FastAPI, Streamlit and Shiny for Python. Naturally all of this web app work comes with some Javascript, Typescript and UI/frontend frameworks (although Iâ€™ll admit I am slightly less comfortable with these than I am with R or Python)."
