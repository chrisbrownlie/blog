# Ahoy

Hello there, this is my new blog! :wave: I hope you find something
interesting or useful here, but don't hold your breath :grinning:

My reasoning for setting this up is threefold:

-   I've been posting 'This week in R' on LinkedIn for a while now, but
    wanted them to also be hosted somewhere they are easier to navigate
    (i.e. so if you miss a few weeks you can quickly scan back over
    them).

-   I want to start writing some more different types of code-based
    articles, so LinkedIn isn't a viable option if I want to keep
    everything in one place.

-   I'm planning to update my personal site and want to embed this blog
    in there, for funsies.

# Me, myself and I

I'm an Analytics Consultant/Data Scientist/{insert job title that will 'soon be 
replaced by AI'}, working in the
UK. I use R for my work and many of the posts here will use R, but my
area of interest and expertise lies in **data-based web applications**.
By which I mean, web apps that have the primary use of analysing,
visualising, or accessibilising (?) data.

In my current day job I primarily do this using R Shiny (which I am a
big fan and proponent of), but I also use Python-based frameworks like
FastAPI, Streamlit and Shiny for Python. Naturally all of this web app
work comes with some Javascript, Typescript and UI/frontend frameworks
(although I'll admit I am slightly less at home with these than I am
with R or Python, I am not a front-end developer :shivers:).
