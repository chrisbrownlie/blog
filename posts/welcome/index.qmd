# Ahoy

Hello there, this is my new blog! :wave: I hope you find something interesting or 
useful here, but don't hold your breath :grinning:

My reasoning for setting this up is threefold:

- I've been posting 'This week in R' on LinkedIn for a while now, but wanted
them to also be hosted somewhere they are easier to navigate (i.e. so if you
miss a few weeks you can quickly scan back over them).

- I want to start writing some more different types of code-based articles,
so LinkedIn isn't a viable option if I want to keep everything in one place.

- I'm planning to update my personal site and want to embed this blog in there,
for funsies.

# Me, myself and I

I'm an analytics consultant/data scientist/AI placeholder working in the UK.
I use R for my work and many of the posts here will use R, but my area of
interest and expertise lies in **data-based web applications**. By which I mean,
web apps that have the primary use of analysing, visualising, or accessibilising (?)
data.

In my current day job I primarily do this using R Shiny (which I am a big fan and
proponent of), but I also use Python-based frameworks like FastAPI, Streamlit and
Shiny for Python. Naturally all of this web app work comes with some Javascript, 
Typescript and UI/frontend frameworks (although I'll admit I am slightly less
comfortable with these than I am with R or Python).
