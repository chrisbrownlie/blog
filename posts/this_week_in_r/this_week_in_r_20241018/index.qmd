Happy Friday everyone! Here\'s some news from the world of R this week:

-   **Hello Positron:** Julia Silge has [released a video introducing
    Positron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BojM5EciPs){target="_blank"},
    the new IDE from Posit which is a fork of VSCode. In the screencast
    Julia shows the key parts of the IDE using a TidyTuesday dataset on
    orcas. If you\'ve been wondering about Positron since it went into
    public beta then check out the video!

-   **Give me data:** Yohann Mansiaux has [written a blog
    post](https://rtask.thinkr.fr/beyond-functions-how-to-enrich-an-r-package-with-data/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} detailing the ways you can include data in
    your R package, and why you should do so! This is an often
    overlooked element of R package development and Yohann gives a good
    overview of the topic.

-   **Pharmers Unite**: R/Pharma 2024 starts next week and [they have
    announced the 19 free
    workshops](https://rinpharma.com/post/2024-10-13-workshops/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} that will be delivered over the course of
    the event. These workshops will be recorded and released on Youtube
    at a later point. I highly recommend you check out the list as many
    of them will be invaluable to all R developers, not just those in
    pharma. You can also still [register for the event here for
    free!](https://events.zoom.us/ev/AvobJEOTVwkUnH6_TgLZDZJauk4dxfm5jCG8JFNN9zukOcsVLvTN~AmO5XY5HRBcxkKG6Hga1aXZaYtpBSER6jHms1seP-NNOA0dhcQZUGJ2NWg){target="_blank"

-   **Right in the monads**: Jonathan Carroll has [published a blog
    post](https://jcarroll.com.au/2024/10/18/monads-in-r/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} exploring the world of monads! The complex
    statistical concept is very important in computing and Jonathan
    provides an accessible introduction with examples in R, as well as
    introducing [a new {monads}
    package](https://github.com/jonocarroll/monads){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} to help with exploring the topic.

-   **Quarto to go**: Pete Jones has [written a blog
    post](https://petejon.es/posts/2024-10-14-move-quarto-output/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} explaining how to resolve a specific but
    potentially very irritating issue with rendering Quarto outputs to a
    different folder than the source directory. If you\'ve ever tried to
    render to a specific output location and not been happy with the
    results, give Pete\'s post a read!

-   **Fun fact:Â **of the more than 14,000 packages on CRAN that depend
    on a minimum R version, v3.5.0 is the most common with nearly 3,000
    packages requiring it. Additionally, 3.x.x is the most common
    required major version (63% of the 14k) and three packages have a
    minimum R version requirement of 0.x!

### New versions:

-   [{openxlsx2)
    v1.10](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/releases/tag/v1.10){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} bug fixes and some new features for the
    \'swiss knife for working with openxml formats\'.

-   [{shiny.telemetry}
    v0.3.1](https://appsilon.github.io/shiny.telemetry/news/index.html#shinytelemetry-031){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - Appsilon\'s shiny logging package gets a
    new *log_errors* method and some bug fixes.
