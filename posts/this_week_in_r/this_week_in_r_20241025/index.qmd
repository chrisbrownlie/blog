Happy Friday everyone! Here\'s some news from the world of R this week:

-   **Shiny gold medals:** Posit have [announced the winners of the 2024
    Shiny
    Contest](https://posit.co/blog/winners-of-the-2024-shiny-contest/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}. Congratulations to the winners David &
    Maxime, [their app submission
    \'Curbcut\'](https://montreal.curbcut.ca){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} is a very impressive, complex and complete
    shiny app - and a great example of everything that is possible with
    shiny. Congratulations to all the runners up (my favourite is [\'Oh
    my
    bag!\'](https://forum.posit.co/t/oh-my-bag-the-heist-of-the-century-shiny-contest-submission/190322){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}) and honourable mentions too!

-   **Calling out Quarto:** James Balamuta has [developed a new Quarto
    extension](https://quarto.thecoatlessprofessor.com/custom-callout/qcustom-callout-faq.html){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} for adding custom callouts to your
    document. You can specify how the new callout type should look in
    your \_quarto.yml file and then reuse them throughout your document!
    Currently only available for HTML outputs but definitely looks
    useful.

-   **Not R but still R**: Jumping Rivers have released the first video
    from the London SatRdays meetup back in April. The first talk is
    from [Andrie de Vries talking about project management in data
    science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a24zTro3CQ){target="_blank"}.
    Although Andrie himself says the talk is not about R, I\'ve included
    it as it is a useful (perhaps underappreciated) topic that us R
    developers should be thinking about!

-   **Spaceships and rockets**: ROpenSci have updated [the documentation
    for the R-Universe
    API,](https://docs.r-universe.dev/browse/api.html){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} and Maëlle and Jeroen have also developed a
    new R package to simplify accessing it. The package isn\'t yet on
    CRAN but you can [see it and install it from Github
    here.](https://github.com/ropensci/universe/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} The package has functions for opting into
    to a universe and extracting data on packages.

-   **Get involved**: ROpenSci have [announced some new
    activities](https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/10/22/first-time-contributions/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} aimed at people wanting to make their first
    contribution to open source software! They will be organising a
    community call in January and a mini hackathon to help people get
    over the intimidation of their first contribution. They are
    currently looking for maintainers of ROpenSci packages to help get
    involved.

-   **Fun fact: **did you know, since R v4.0.0 you can specify raw
    strings in base R using the r\"( notation? This can make it easier
    to use both single and double quotes in the same string.

<!-- -->

### New versions:

-   [{duckdb}
    v1.1.1.9001](https://duckdb.r-universe.dev/duckdb){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - (on R-universe, soon to be on CRAN) new
    feature to interrupt long-running queries in RStudio with Ctrl+C.

-   [{drat}
    0.2.5](https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2024/10/21/#drat_0.2.5){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - some small updates to Dirk
    Eddelbuettel\'s package for managing local R package repositories.

I post updates like this every week so if you\'re interested feel free
