Happy Friday everyone! Here\'s some news from the world of R this week:

-   **Tricks and Treats: **as part of
    [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}, Jonathan Carroll has created a repository
    aimed at helping R users get started with Github and open source by
    providing a
    {[safespace](https://github.com/jonocarroll/safespace){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}} for them to try creating pull requests. If
    you\'ve ever wanted to get started with Github or open source but
    weren\'t sure where to start, check out his [blog post
    here.](https://jcarroll.com.au/2024/10/01/a-safe-space-for-learning-how-to-make-pull-requests/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}

-   **Monopoly skills:** Etienne Bacher has [written a blog
    post](https://www.etiennebacher.com/posts/2024-10-01-using-property-testing-in-r/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} explaining property-based testing in R,
    using the
    {[quickcheck](https://armcn.github.io/quickcheck/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}} package. This kind of testing integrates
    seamlessly with {testthat} and is useful to know as an alternative
    way to approach unit tests!

-   **Hardcore Parquet!:** Ted Laderas has [published an
    introduction](https://hutchdatascience.org/data_snacks/r_snacks/parquet.html#a-titanic-parquet-file){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} to using parquet and DuckDB to get
    blistering fast results on large datasets. I think this combination
    could well be the future of large dataset manipulation in R and Ted
    gives a good introduction, using quarto-live to include runnable
    chunks of R code!

-   **A Shiny future:** Jasmine Daly has [written up a
    forecast](https://www.dalyanalytics.com/blog/shiny-trends-2025){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} for what will be the biggest trends in
    Shiny development in 2025. I have to say I agree on the whole,
    particularly that we\'ll see more serverless apps with
    {[shinylive](https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}} and more large data manipulation with
    {[duckdb](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}}.

-   **Covering all bases: **Posit have [produced an
    article](https://posit.co/blog/databases-with-posit/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} outlining the best way to connect to
    DuckDB, Snowflake or Databricks databases, in both R and Python.
    Very useful if you are using any of these DBMSs in an enterprise
    setting.

-   **Clean up the books:** R-Consortium\'s latest Tidy Finance webinar
    is next Wednesday 9th October, and will cover evaluating performance
    with the Capital Asset Pricing Model in R. You can [sign up to the
    webinar](https://r-consortium.org/webinars/tidy-finance-webinar-series.html#evaluate-performance-using-the-capital-asset-pricing-model){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} here.

-   **Fun fact:  **did you know, base R has functionality for working
    with Roman numerals\...
