Another Friday, another R-eview! Here\'s some news from the world of R
this week:

-   **Quick quack: **Art Steinmetz [published an interesting
    article](https://outsiderdata.netlify.app/posts/2024-04-10-the-truth-about-tidy-wrappers/benchmark_wrappers.html){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} looking at the various different tidyverse
    wrappers around powerful database engines, as a solution for working
    with large data in the tidyverse. The results are in and the new
    {duckplyr} wrapper around DuckDB seems to blow the competition out
    of the water in terms of speed.

-   **Catching the worm:** early bird tickets for EARL (Enterprise
    Applications of the R Language) conference in Brighton this
    September have been released this week. [See here for more
    information](https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2024/04/08/earl-early-bird-tickets-are-now-available){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} including the keynote speakers.

-   **Databases:  **Hadley Wickham has [written a release
    article](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2024/04/dbplyr-2-5-0/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} for {dbplyr} v2.5.0 which was released last
    month. The new release contains improvements to syntax for
    specifying tables as well as some minor improvements to SQL
    generation.

-   **R-hub evolution:  **Gabor Csardi has announced that R-hub is being
    retired in favour of the sparkly new modernised R-hub v2. This new
    iteration of R-hub is built on Github Actions and [Gabor\'s article
    here
    explains](https://blog.r-hub.io/2024/04/11/rhub2/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} how to move from v1 to v2.

-   **Quiz:** what will be the output of the two lines of code below,
    and why? Try it yourself and find out!
