Happy Friday everyone! Here\'s some news from the world of R:

-   **RStudio & Docker:** Rami Krispin has published a [tutorial on
    running RStudio Server inside a Docker
    container](https://towardsdatascience.com/running-rstudio-inside-a-container-e9db5e809ff8){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}. A great starting point for any R users
    wanting to learn more about Docker and the images that the [Rocker
    project](https://rocker-project.org/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} provides.

-   **Fast statistics: **Sebastian Krantz has [written an
    article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05038){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} about his package
    [{collapse}](https://sebkrantz.github.io/collapse/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}, which aims to provide fast, efficient data
    manipulation and statistics via C/C++. An intriguing package that I
    haven\'t delved into myself, but is growing in popularity and
    well-maintained - v2.0.11 was released 4 days ago.

-   **Financial economics:  **Christoph Scheuch et al. have released the
    [first version of their new {tidyfinance}
    package](https://www.tidy-finance.org/blog/r-tidyfinance-0-1-0/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} onto CRAN, providing helper functions for
    approaching economics and finance in a tidyverse framework.

-   **High performance parallel computing:** [this blog
    post](https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2024/03/12/isc-funded-grant-secure-tls-connections-in-nanonext-and-mirai-facilitating-high-performance-computing-in-the-life-sciences){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} discusses a group of packages I\'ve been
    keeping my eye on which are built on
    [{nanonext}](https://shikokuchuo.net/nanonext/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}, a binding to the state of the art C
    library \'NNG\' (Nanomessage Next Generation). Packages like
    [{mirai}](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} and
    [{crew}](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} have built on this and are starting to
    create an exciting ecosystem of packages for efficient, elegant
    parallel computing.

-   **Open source:  **ROpenSci have released a new version of their dev
    guide - [this blog
    post](https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/03/11/devguide-0.9.0/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} discusses the latest changes including
    improvements to packaging and Github guidance, as well as a Spanish
    translation and other improvements.

-   **Fun fact:  **Try running the below in R

### New package versions:

-   [{arrow}
    v15.0.1](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/news/index.html#arrow-1501){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - the latest release includes bindings for
    additional base R functions.

-   [{xxhashlite}
    v0.2.2](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/xxhashlite){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - a newer package which provides fast
    hashing of objects via the \'xxHash\' C library.

I post updates like this every week so if you\'re interested feel free

this week too!
