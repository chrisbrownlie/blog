Happy Friday everyone! Here\'s some news from the world of R this week:

-   **Peeky-boo:** James Balamuta\'s [latest R package
    {peeky}](https://r-pkg.thecoatlessprofessor.com/peeky/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} helps you extract, examine, and run the
    source code of Shinylive applications. The functionality reiterates
    the idea that in Shinylive applications \"there are no secrets\".
    You can [check out the package on
    Github](https://github.com/coatless-rpkg/peeky){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} and start dissecting shinylive apps
    yourself!

-   **Brand(.yml) new**: the next edition of Quarto will support
    [brand.yml - a concept from
    Posit](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} which allows you to specify brand
    guidelines for logos, colours, fonts, plots and more in a single
    \_brand.yml file which can then be reused across your R, Python and
    Quarto projects! Currently it is only supported in Shiny for Python,
    but with it being [added to the prelease version of
    Quarto](https://prerelease.quarto.org/docs/authoring/brand.html){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} and [planned for R Shiny in the near
    future](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/#fn1:~:text=Support%20for%20Shiny%20for%20R%20is%20expected%20to%20arrive%20in%20the%20very%20near%20future){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} it looks to be a useful addition to the
    Posit suite of tools.

-   **Bricks and mortar**: the [{brickster}
    package](https://databrickslabs.github.io/brickster/index.html){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} for interacting with Databricks is [now on
    CRAN](https://github.com/databrickslabs/brickster/releases/tag/v0.2.5){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}! Produced by the Databricks labs team, the
    package provides a toolkit for interacting with some of the
    Databricks APIs and provides different options for running code
    against Databricks from within R.

-   **Dev-ing deep:** Heather Turner has [written a blog
    post](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/r-dev-day-2024/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} reflecting on the R Dev Day that ran
    alongside Shiny in Production 2024 last month. The article gives a
    very interesting insight into how the day works and how bugs are
    fixed and new R features developed, as well how to get involved at
    [next years
    conference](https://shiny-in-production.jumpingrivers.com/#registration){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}.

-   **Love your craft**: Sergej Ruff has release a [new R package on
    Github -
    {lovecraftr}](https://github.com/SergejRuff/lovecraftr){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - which contains the text from H.P.
    Lovecraft\'s most well-known stories, in an easily accessible
    format. This looks to be a great resource for anyone looking to test
    out their text analysis skills on a new dataset!

-   **Quiz:Â **how well do you know your NAs? Guess what each of the
    below lines will return, then test it yourself to find out! Let me
    know your score out of 8!
