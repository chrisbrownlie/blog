Happy Friday everyone! Here\'s some news from the world of R this week:

-   **You\'re a wizard, Quarto:** Mickaël Canouil has created [a new VS
    Code
    extension](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-wizard){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} which helps you to manage your Quarto
    projects. It includes functionality for installing extensions and
    creating new documents which may come in handy if you\'re writing
    Quarto documents in VS Code (or in future, Positron).

-   **Scouting for bars**: David Granjon has [developed a new R package
    {scoutbaR}](https://github.com/cynkra/scoutbaR){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} which wraps the \'scoutbar\' React widget.
    The package makes it easy to include a scoutbar element in your
    shiny app - an exciting way to modernise and improve your existing
    shiny apps. C[heck out the
    documentation](https://cynkra.github.io/scoutbaR/index.html){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} for an example of what it looks like.

-   **You Quarto know this**: Posit\'s Charlotte Wickham has published
    [a series of video
    tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7r24gTEkEY&feature=youtu.be){target="_blank"}
    focussed around Quarto websites. They cover the basics of setting up
    a homepage and navigating between pages, to customising with CSS and
    using the inbuilt listings functionality. If you\'re looking to
    create a new website or blog and want to use Quarto to do so, I
    recommend checking out these tutorials to get started!

-   **PaLLM of your hand:** Simon Couch has [developed a new R package
    {pal}](https://simonpcouch.github.io/pal/index.html){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} which aims to provide a selection of
    LLM-backed helpers for completing repetitive tasks in R. One example
    is an addin that generates roxygen documentation for your functions,
    giving you a good starting point to build from. Usage of LLMs
    continues to increase across the board in R!

-   **LondonR**: last week I attended the LondonR meetup, where Hannah
    Frick gave an excellent talk on the state of the union for
    {tidymodels}, including the {tailor} and {sparsevctrs} packages. You
    can [see Hannah\'s slides
    here](https://hfrick.github.io/2024-LondonR/#/title-slide){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}, and shout out to Datacove for organising
    the meetup!

-   **Fun fact: **did you know you can use [{stringr}s
    str_view()](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_view.html){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} function to see how your regex pattern
    matches a string?

### New versions:

-   [{galah}
    v2.1.0](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/galah-R/releases/tag/v2.1.0){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - improvements and documentation updates
    for the very useful biodiversity data package.

<!-- -->

-   [{tinytable}
    0.6.0](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/tinytable/blob/main/NEWS.md){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - internal refactors, bug fixes and
    consistency improvements to this small, minimalistic table drawing
    package.

I post updates like this every week so if you\'re interested feel free
to follow. Comment below if there\'s something interesting you found out
this week too!
