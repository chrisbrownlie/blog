Happy Friday everyone! After a short Easter hiatus, here\'s some news
from the world of R this week:

-   **Quack quack: **in some very exciting news, DuckDB have teamed up
    with the good folk at Posit and [developed
    {duckplyr}](https://duckdb.org/2024/04/02/duckplyr.html){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}, enabling integration of DuckDB into a tidy
    R workflow. This could prove to provide significant performance
    boosts in future and is just all-round a pretty cool project!

-   **Tidy survival:** the {tidymodels} team have released yet another
    update, this time providing functionality for performing survey
    analysis. See the [blog post
    here](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2024/04/tidymodels-survival-analysis/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} for more info.

-   **Shiny shared states:  **Jacob Sobolewski has written [an
    interesting blog
    post](https://jakubsob.github.io/blog/the-other-way-of-lifting-state-up-from-shiny-modules/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} proposing another way to share state
    between Shiny modules - an alternative to the relatively well
    established methods of return values and using {R6} classes. He
    takes inspiration from React and although this method won\'t be for
    everyone it is cool to see people come up with novel solutions to
    the problem of state-sharing in a shiny app.

-   **Dive into packages:  **Mohsen Asgari has [written a
    guide](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-create-r-package-integrated-shiny-apps-mohsen-asgari--94she/){target="_blank"}
    for how to get started with creating packages in R. In particular,
    he focusses on creating a package that contains one or more shiny
    apps.

-   **12 sleeps:** with less than 2 weeks to go, the [ShinyConf agenda
    has been
    released](https://www.shinyconf.com/shinyconf-2024-agenda#sz-tab-45399){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}. There\'s still time to register if you
    haven\'t already!

-   **Fun fact:  **in the two weeks since my last update, 527 new
    package versions have been published to CRAN\...

<!-- -->

### New package versions:

-   [{shinyWidgets}
    0.8.4](https://dreamrs.github.io/shinyWidgets/news/index.html#shinywidgets-084){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - bug fixes and new widgets including
    WinBox() for managing multiple windows.

-   [{bslib}
    0.7.0](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/news/index.html#bslib-070){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - many bug fixes and new
    input_task_button() widget.
