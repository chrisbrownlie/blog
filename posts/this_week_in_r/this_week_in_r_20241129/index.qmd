Happy Friday everyone! Here\'s some news from the world of R this week:

-   ***Brand* new Quarto:** earlier this week, Quarto v1.6 was
    officially released! The new version brings with it some new
    features for RevealJS presentations, new functionality for landscape
    content and perhaps most excitingly, support for the brand.yml - a
    single file that defines branding and styling across formats! Read
    the [release notes
    here.](https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2024-11-25-1.6-release/){target="_blank"

-   **Parquet life**: ROpenSci have announced their Social Coworking
    event for January, which is titled [\'Working with Parquet in
    R\'](https://ropensci.org/events/coworking-2025-01/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}. The event will be hosted by Rainer Krug
    and involve two hours of learning about parquet in a flexible,
    pressure-free environment! [See here for more
    information](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/06/21/coworking/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} on what ROpenSci\'s Social Coworking events
    entail.

-   **AuthRing:** Josiah Parry has [written up a
    guide](https://josiahparry.com/posts/2024-11-28-httr2-oidc#accessing-claims){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} on using OpenID Connect (OIDC)
    authentication from R. OIDC is based on OAuth 2.0 and the article
    gives some great practical guidance on how you can use the {httr2}
    package for integrating with this type of authentication. Josiah
    does a great job of simplifying a fairly complex subject!

-   **Bluesky ahead**: James Balamuta has [created a new Quarto
    extension](https://quarto.thecoatlessprofessor.com/bluesky-comments/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} for seamlessly integrating Bluesky posts
    into your documents. You can use this to include replies on Bluesky
    in your Quarto document. As the new social media platform continues
    to rapidly grow, this new extension provides a great way to
    encourage discussion and integrate Bluesky into your sites!

-   **Fun fact:Â **did you know base R has functions for solving the
    [*birthday
    problem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem){target="_blank"
