Happy Friday everyone! Here\'s some news from the world of R this week:

-   **Scrolly moly:** Posit have [announced the start of a Closeread
    competition](https://posit.co/blog/closeread-prize-announcement/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}! Closeread is [a new Quarto
    extension](https://closeread.dev/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} that helps you write scrollytelling
    stories. Scrollytelling is a method (popular with NYT, BBC and
    others) where concepts are built up or highlighted as the reader
    scrolls down the page, by zooming, transitioning or altering the
    visible element on the page as they do. Posit\'s competition calls
    for entries on any topic to be submitted by 15th December, with some
    cool prizes up for grabs.

-   **Dash-ing through Quarto**: Posit\'s Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel has
    [recorded a three part series on
    Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW7QbqI4fH0){target="_blank"}
    diving into Quarto Dashboards. The functionality has been around for
    almost a year now and these videos dive into all you can do with
    them in both R and Python. The second and third videos look at
    [components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdsQgwaY950){target="_blank"}
    and
    [theming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NigWSB-jG4Y){target="_blank"}
    respectively.

-   **Lucky number S7**: a new version of R\'s latest Object Oriented
    Programming system - meant to become a successor to S3 and S4 - has
    been released! [Tomasz Kalinowski and Hadley Wickham have written a
    blog
    post](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2024/11/s7-0-2-0/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} accompanying this v0.2.0 release. If you
    were unsure about S7 or had some issues with early releases now is
    the time to take another look as it starts to be used in more CRAN
    packages.

-   **Across the webR:** George Stagg has [written a series of blog
    posts](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2024/10/webr-0-4-2/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} about the current state of WebAssembly
    in R. Running R in the browser without a server has been one of the
    hot new areas of development this year and George covers the latest
    in
    [webR](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2024/10/webr-0-4-2/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"},
    [shinylive](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2024/10/shinylive-0-8-0/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} and the new [Quarto Live
    extension](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2024/10/quarto-live-0-1-1){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}!

-   **Action required**: it has been confirmed that [Github Actions will
    be removing
    R](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-11-05-notice-of-breaking-changes-for-github-actions/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} from the \'ubuntu-latest\' image within a
    couple of months for *\"maintenance reasons\".* See the [full list
    of changes
    here.](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/10636){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} Luckily R users have great alternatives for
    using R in Github Actions (or Azure Devops):
    [r2u](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/github-actions/tree/master/r2u-setup){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} and
    [r-lib/actions.](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2-branch/setup-r){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}

-   **Fun fact: **did you know, you can use the {usethis} package to
    setup your global .gitignore with common entries:

<!-- -->

### New versions:

-   [{ntfy}
    v0.0.6](https://github.com/jonocarroll/ntfy/releases/tag/v0.0.6_CRAN){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - an interesting looking newer package
    which wraps the [ntfy.sh](http://ntfy.sh){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} lightweight notification service.

<!-- -->

-   [{httr2}
    v1.0.6](https://github.com/r-lib/httr2/releases/tag/v1.0.6){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - some fixes and new features for
    interacting with AWS.
