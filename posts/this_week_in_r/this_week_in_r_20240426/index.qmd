Happy Friday everyone! Here\'s some news from the world of R this week:

-   **For 4.4 on 24-4-24**: a new version of R is here! The release of
    4.4.0 finished on Wednesday. Some notable new features include: an
    experimental new feature for [tail-call
    optimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}; the addition to base R of the useful
    %\|\|% operator which previously only existed in {rlang} and a new
    pkg2HTML() function for creating single-page reference manuals for R
    packages. See the [full list of changes
    here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.pdf){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}, or Jumping Rivers' Russ Hyde's [writeup of
    the key changes
    here.](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/whats-new-r44/){target="_blank"

<!-- -->

-   **Quarto embedding:** James Balamuta has [developed a Quarto
    extension
    called](https://quarto.thecoatlessprofessor.com/embedio/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}
    [*embedio*](https://quarto.thecoatlessprofessor.com/embedio/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}, which allows you to easily incorporate
    different file types into Quarto HTML documents. This looks to be
    very useful for embedding slides or PDF documents into Quarto
    documents or websites.

-   **Ducks in a row:** another week, [another benchmark showing that
    {duckplyr} is blisteringly
    fast](https://www.hiddenelephants.co.uk/Blog/kicking-tyres.html){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} compared to the current most popular data
    manipulation packages. This time Tim Taylor compared it to
    {data.table} and as you will see in the write-up, there was little
    competition in terms of speed.

-   **DBI Q&A:** R-consortium published a Q&A with Kirill Muller - the
    author of {DBI} - including his thoughts on the future of databases
    and R. [Read the conversation
    here.](https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2024/04/18/building-data-highways-kirill-mullers-journey-in-enhancing-rs-database){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}

-   **Posit-ively excited: **the agenda for posit::conf(2024) [has now
    been
    released](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf24/publiccatalog/page/publiccatalog?search=&tab.day=20240812){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}. The conference in August has more than 60
    sessions across the 3 days and looks like it will be a great
    networking and learning opportunity for those that attend.

-   **ShinyConf success:** ShinyConf 2024 was a great event, with many
    excellent speakers and interesting topics! A personal favourite of
    mine was Deepansh Kurana\'s talk \'How I Built an API for my
    life\' - very interesting and a great use case for {plumber},
    {shiny} and more! You can [read more about his project on his Github
    here.](https://github.com/DeepanshKhurana/Hrafnagud-Dynamo){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}

-   **Quiz: **how well do you know your Date-a types in R? Which of the
    below will throw an error, and what will the others return? Try for
    yourself to see if you got it right\...
