Happy Friday everyone! Here\'s some news from the world of R this week:

-   **OOPs, I did it again: **Veerle Eeftink-van Leemput has [written a
    blog
    post](https://hypebright.nl/index.php/en/2024/09/25/s7-a-new-object-oriented-programming-system-in-r-2/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} which is a great introduction to the newest
    of R\'s Object Oriented Programming frameworks: **S7**. A successor
    to S3 and S4, there are long term plans to integrate S7 into base R
    so its definitely something worth knowing about!

-   **New RStudio version:** the new version of RStudio IDE was released
    this week (2024.09.0 \"Cranberry Hibiscus\"). See [here for an
    overview of what\'s
    new](https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-2024-09-0-whats-new/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} and [here for the full list of bug
    fixes](https://docs.posit.co/ide/news/#fixed){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}.

-   **Exploring our universe:** ROpenSci had a community call this week,
    in which Jeroen Ooms talked about
    [R-Universe](https://docs.r-universe.dev/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}, how it has developed and how you can use
    it today - [watch the recording
    here](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/nov2024-r-universe/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}. I think R-Universe could well be the
    future of sharing open source packages, so its worth checking out.

-   **Interactivity ftw!:** Sherry Zhang & Dianne Cook have [written a
    new CRAN task view for Dynamic Visualizations and Interactive
    Graphics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/DynamicVisualizations.html){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}*.* As with other task views, it is the
    perfect place to start if you have a problem relating to plotting an
    interactive graphic!

-   **Get out, liers: **Steven Sanderson has [written a blog post
    explaining how to go about removing outliers from a
    dataset](https://www.spsanderson.com/steveondata/posts/2024-09-24/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}. This is a good place to start if you\'re
    unsure how to about detecting and removing outliers in your data.

-   **Quiz time: **do you know the answer to these questions? *Answers
    at the bottom of the page!*

**1)** What does the C in CRAN stand for?

**2)** In what year was R v4.0.0 released?

**3)** To the nearest thousand, how many R packages are currently
available on CRAN?

### New package versions:

-   [{surveydown}
    0.3.0](https://surveydown.org/blog/2024-09-18-new-app-design/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - a significant API overhaul for the
    markdown based survey package

-   [{renv}
    v1.0.9](https://github.com/rstudio/renv/releases/tag/v1.0.9){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - a couple of bug fixes, following from [a
    larger v1.0.8
    release](https://github.com/rstudio/renv/releases/tag/v1.0.8){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} last week.
