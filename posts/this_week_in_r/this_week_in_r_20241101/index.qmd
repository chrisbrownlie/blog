Happy Friday everyone! Here\'s some news from the world of R this week:

-   **Conf Content:** the materials from posit::conf(2024) have been
    released! Over 30 hours of recordings and workshops covering all
    manner of R-related topics. [See the extensive list of content
    here!](https://posit.co/blog/talks-and-workshops-from-posit-conf-2024/){target="_blank"

-   **\'Ex\'-social media**: the last couple of weeks have seen many R
    users moving their social media presence to BlueSky (mainly from X).
    Since the demise of Twitter, R enthusiasts have been spread across
    many different platforms, but it looks like many are starting to
    concentrate on BlueSky - the Twitter-like interface is probably a
    factor. Jeremy Allen has also [created a starter pack of the best R
    people](https://go.bsky.app/Ki7PjpS){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} to follow, which you can use to easily get
    started in the community.

-   **Awesome icons:** Jon Harmon has [developed a new package
    {favawesome}](https://github.com/shinyworks/favawesome){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} for easily adding font awesome icons as
    favicons in shiny and other HTML pages. If you\'re developing a
    shiny app this gives a nice easy way to make your app look a bit
    more professional and doesn\'t add any additional dependencies.

-   **CaRd games**: Matt Dray has [written a blog
    post](https://www.rostrum.blog/posts/2024-10-25-not-balatro/index.html){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} explaining how he used the {sortable} R
    package to create a card game in shiny. An entertaining read from
    the man who has championed using R to create games (\"[R is a game
    engine. Fight
    me.](https://www.rostrum.blog/posts/2023-04-02-splendid-r-games/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}\") - I highly recommend you check it out!

-   **Chromote control**: James Balamuta has [recorded a
    video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30AOpjLeOyI){target="_blank"}
    on scraping data from a dynamically generated website using the
    {chromote} package. This is a very useful tutorial for a common
    difficult task when trying to scrape data from the web.

-   **Pitching Positron**: a [new Positron website has
    appeared](https://positron.posit.co/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} with some more information on what Positron
    is and who it is aimed at. Although it is still very early days and
    the site is minimal, it does give some background on the IDE and how
    to get started with it.

-   **Fun fact:Â **did you know, you can infinitely nest environments?
    Not that you would want to\...but it does give some insight into
    [how environments
    work.](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/environments.html){target="_blank"
