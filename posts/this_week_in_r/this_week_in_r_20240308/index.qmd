Happy Friday everyone! Here\'s some news from the world of R:

-   **Web scraping: ** Hadley Wickham gave a talk last night about web
    scraping using {rvest} and the tidyverse, I\'m not sure if it was
    recorded (can\'t find anything online) but the [slides are
    here](https://github.com/hadley/web-scraping/blob/main/rvest.pdf){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} and seem well-developed so might be of
    interest.

-   **Data editing shiny app:  **David Granjon is working on a (still
    very experimental) package which would allow you to [quickly create
    a shiny app that sits on top of a database and edits it via an
    app](https://github.com/DivadNojnarg/shiny-edit-data){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}. It's a pretty common use case for shiny
    but I imagine generalising it will be *hard* so I\'d be interested
    to know if any of you dig into it at all!

-   **webR:  **Colin Fay has continued his series of blog posts looking
    into {webR} - [the latest
    one](https://colinfay.me/webrcli-and-spidyr/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} discusses the best way to structure a
    project that interweaves R and JS seamlessly. If you\'re interested
    in the development of {webR} and running R in the browser, I\'d
    recommend checking out the rest of his blog posts too.

-   **Open source:  **Julia Silge & ROpenSci are [looking for
    volunteers](https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/03/01/qualtrics-call-help/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} to help get involved with
    testing/developing the {qualtRics} package (something that we at BW
    currently use). Sounds like it could a good opportunity for someone
    wanting to dip their toe into open source development.

-   **Fun fact:  **Try running the below in R (or replace hello with
    anything else)...

### New package versions:

-   [{shinyWidgets}
    0.8.2](https://dreamrs.github.io/shinyWidgets/news/index.html#shinywidgets-082){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - added support for dropdown inputs with
    virtual scroll.

-   [{renv}
    1.0.5](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/news/index.html#renv-105){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - some minor bug fixes as a follow up to
    1.0.4 a couple weeks ago which added some new features.

I\'ll be looking to start posting updates like this every week so if
you\'re interested feel free to follow. Comment below if there\'s
something interesting you found out this week too!
