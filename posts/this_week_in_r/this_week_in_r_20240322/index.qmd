Happy Friday everyone! Here\'s some news from the world of R:

-   **Fair ML:** the tidymodels team released some new functionality
    this week centred around increasing fairness in statistical models.
    It involved some updates to {yardstick} and {tune} - see [the blog
    post](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2024/03/tidymodels-fairness/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} for more details. Another good sign for
    tidymodels users that the ecosystem is heading in the right
    direction.

-   **Wet testing:** Maelle Salmon has [written up an
    overview](https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/03/18/dry-damp/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} of an ROpenSci training session, explaining
    two useful acronyms to remember: DRY (Don\'t Repeat Yourself) and
    DAMP (Descriptive and Meaningful Phrases), specifically in
    application to writing tests for an R package. Definitely worth a
    read for any R users who are newer to writing tests - or writing
    code in general! Maelle has also [written a great
    update](https://blog.r-hub.io/2024/03/21/mocking-new-take){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} on the state of mocking for R package
    testing this week, which I also recommend checking out.

-   **Quarto, webR + shinylive: Â **James Balamuta has [developed a
    tutorial](https://github.com/coatless-tutorials/quarto-webr-with-quarto-shinylive){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} giving an example of how to integrate both
    {quarto-webr} and {quarto-shinylive} Quarto extensions into the same
    document. This is a very cool look at the future of browser-based R
    and for me brings to life the possibilities - particularly around
    learning/teaching. The document itself can be seen
    [here](https://tutorials.thecoatlessprofessor.com/quarto-webr-with-quarto-shinylive/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}, hosted on James\' website.

-   **(En)coding: Â **[GÃ¡bor CsÃ¡rdi\'s R Encoding FAQ
    repository](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/rencfaq){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} has had some minor updates this past week.
    If you have ever run into an error in your code that has taken days
    to resolve, and when you resolve it you feel like you still don\'t
    know why, and that error has been related to encoding (I\'m speaking
    from experience here, if you hadn\'t guessed) - then I highly
    recommend bookmarking this repository and taking a look at some of
    the resources.

-   **Fun fact:Â Â **what would you expect the output of the two lines
    below to be? Run them and see for yourself\...

### New package versions:

-   [{zstdlite}
    0.2.7](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/zstdlite){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - a newer package from [Mike
    (@coolbutuseless)](https://github.com/coolbutuseless){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} which uses the C-based zstd library for
    fast and configurable (de/)serialisation of R objects. Possibly a
    better alternative to saveRDS()/readRDS() in some cases.

-   [{mirai}
    0.13.1](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/news/index.html#mirai-0131){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - a fix for working with {targets} and
    customisation of serialisation.

I\'ll be posting updates like this every week so if you\'re interested
feel free to follow. Comment below if there\'s something interesting you
found out this week too!
