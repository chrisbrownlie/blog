Happy Friday everyone! Here\'s some news from the world of R this week:

-   **A Shiny new Assistant:Â **Posit have released Shiny Assistant, an
    instance of the Claude 3.5 Sonnet LLM which is specialised in Shiny
    app development in both R and Python. Read [the announcement
    here](https://shiny.posit.co/blog/posts/shiny-assistant/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} and [play around with assistant
    here.](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/assistant/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}

-   **Funky file systems:** Danielle Navarro has [written a very
    entertaining blog post about
    {fs}](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2024-10-06_fs/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}and why it is an underappreciated package in
    R data science workflows. If you are using file paths at all or
    developing and deploying on different OS\', you should definitely
    read it!

-   **Duck Duck loose:** Stephen Turner has [written a blog post
    comparing
    DuckDB](https://blog.stephenturner.us/p/duckdb-vs-dplyr-vs-base-r){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} to base R and {readr}/{dplyr}, and found
    DuckDB to be 125x faster than base R! The post includes some
    information about {duckplyr}, the package for interacting with
    DuckDB using {dplyr}-like syntax.

-   **Tinker Tailor:** The tidymodels team have [announced the latest
    addition to their
    ecosystem](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2024/10/postprocessing-preview/#whats-to-come){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - {tailor}. This new package \"*is to
    postprocessing as {recipes} is to preprocessing*\" and is something
    that has been highly anticipated. The package is not yet on CRAN but
    you can [check out the Github
    here.](https://github.com/tidymodels/tailor){target="_blank"

-   **Shiny in Production:Â **I attended another excellent conference in
    Newcastle this week, congrats to Jumping Rivers and all the sponsors
    and speakers for putting on a great event. Some personal favourites
    were: [ðŸŒž Tan
    Ho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tan-ho?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAgJvb8BAtUPVKEll80g7O1UMD6RNugGlMk){target="_blank"}\'s
    reflections on a large-scale shiny app project; [Gareth
    Burns](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drgarethburns?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAjITXQBAw52DJvrmWl5apZtT8QeYcVbHlk){target="_blank"}\'
    journey using shiny as an interactive education tool; [Alasdair
    Morgan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABGrpu8BjweS_hr5hah92ehTUOS_PvNHLLU?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAABGrpu8BjweS_hr5hah92ehTUOS_PvNHLLU){target="_blank"}\'s
    lightning talk on correcting resource usage on Posit Workbench, and
    Katy Morgan\'s discussion on integrating Gen AI into an auditing
    shiny app. Talks were recorded and next year\'s instalment of the
    conference has already been confirmed so [keep an eye out here for
    announcements.](https://shiny-in-production.jumpingrivers.com/){target="_blank"

-   **Fun fact:Â Â **did you know, there were 1203 downloads of R versions
    3.x.x or even 2.x.x [from the RStudio CRAN
    mirror](https://github.com/r-hub/cranlogs){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} in the last 30 days?! Thankfully that only
    accounts for less than 0.2% of all R downloads in that time period.

### New versions:

-   [{data.table}
    v1.16.2](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/blob/1.16.2/NEWS.md#datatable-v1162-9-october-2024){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} the latest release of the super fast table
    package includes various bug fixes.
