Happy Friday everyone! May the 4th be (almost) with you, here\'s some
news from the world of R this week:

-   **DangeR?:** researchers at Hidden Layer have [found a potential
    vulnerability in R \<
    4.4.0](https://hiddenlayer.com/research/r-bitrary-code-execution/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}, which allows arbitrary code execution when
    an RDS file is loaded. The exploit involves returning a promise
    using the headers of the file. The vulnerability is claimed to have
    been fixed in the latest version of R.

-   **The RDS-ponse**: the response to the vulnerability mentioned above
    has been mixed, with many of the opinion that it isn\'t a
    vulnerability at all and/or hasn\'t been resolved in the latest
    version of R as it is still possible to execute malicious code when
    an RDS file is read in. The general consensus is that you should
    *always* be very wary when reading in RDS files from an unknown
    source. Bob Rudis has [started working on an \'rdaradar\' tool for
    sanity checking unknown R data
    files](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/rdaradar){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - see the README of that project for an
    explanation of why it might not be considered a vulnerability, and
    how these types of files can still be used in malicious attacks.

-   **They have consequences**: Rami Krispin has [released a new
    LinkedIn learning
    course](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rami-krispin_rstats-python-datascience-activity-7189969280883462144-glKc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop){target="_blank"}
    for setting up automation with Github Actions using both R and
    Python. It looks to be a great starting point for anyone wanting to
    automate some tedious or troublesome tasks!

-   **Tidy update**: the {tidymodels} team have [published a Q1 2024
    roundup
    post](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2024/04/tidymodels-2024-q1/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}, highlighting all the changes to their
    packages in the first few months of 2024. The article also
    highlights some of the key changes and new package versions.

-   **Fun fact:** did you know Florian Rupprecht has [a Github site for
    tracking incoming CRAN
    packages](https://nx10.github.io/cransubs/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}? You can use it to see packages which have
    been submitted to CRAN and where they are in the approval process.

### New package versions:

-   [{nanonext}
    1.0.0](https://shikokuchuo.net/nanonext/news/index.html#nanonext-100){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}: Charlie Gao has - with contributions from
    Joe Cheng - released the first major version of this exciting
    package, which includes integration with {later}.

-   [{webR}
    0.3.3](https://github.com/r-wasm/webr/releases/tag/v0.3.3){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}: improvements to version identification and
    bug fixes.

I post updates like this every week so if you\'re interested feel free
to follow. Comment below if there\'s something interesting you found out
this week too!
