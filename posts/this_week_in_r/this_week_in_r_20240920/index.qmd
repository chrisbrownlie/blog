Happy Friday everyone! After a long hiatus (I took a sabbatical and did
some travelling), we\'re back! Here\'s some news from the world of R
this week - **plus a couple of news items from the past 4 months**:

-   **Vaping comes to R?:** a new \'typed superset of R\' is being
    developed and the alpha release is now here. The brainchild of John
    Coene (of \'[Javascript for
    R](https://book.javascript-for-r.com/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}\' fame),
    [*Vapour*](https://github.com/vapourlang/vapour/releases){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} aims to improve the robustness of R code by
    using type checking and providing pre-processing like static type
    checks. [Read John\'s blog
    post](https://vapour.run/glob/vapour-release){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} for more info on the reasoning behind it.

-   **An IDE, not a Transformer: **In June, Posit announced and released
    into public beta [their new IDE -
    Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}. The product is a fork of VS Code that is
    aimed at R and Python developers, potentially providing a way for R
    users to dip their toes in Python\'s muddy waters by providing some
    of the home comforts of RStudio in a more generalised IDE. Positron
    is still in public beta phase so has some growing up to do yet, but
    early feedback is posit(ron)ive and personally I\'m enjoying it for
    Python development myself!

-   **Multi-task like a pro**: Andres Quintero has [recorded a short
    tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQEdbrb2iTc){target="_blank"}
    on how to get multiple shiny apps running in the same Docker image,
    using [ixpantia\'s faucet framework for routing and load balancing R
    applications.](https://github.com/ixpantia/faucet){target="_blank"

-   **Quilts, rugs and\...plots?:** v1.3.0 of the
    [{patchwork}](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} package has now been released, bringing
    some extra functionality for arranging and composing multiple
    {ggplot2} plots. One of the key new features is the ability to
    arrange {gt} tables in the same way. See [the tidyverse blog post
    here.](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2024/09/patchwork-1-3-0/#tables-are-figures-too){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}

-   **Shiny in Production:** The annual Shiny in Production conference
    hosted by Jumping Rivers is only a few weeks away, with the speakers
    and workshops now announced. Next Wednesday (25th September) is your
    last day to get a ticket so [check out the schedule and information
    here!](https://shiny-in-production.jumpingrivers.com/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}

-   **Conference season:** I\'ve heard from friends and colleagues that
    both posit::conf(2024) and EARL 2024 were great successes over the
    past few months, with many interesting and inspiring talks. [See the
    posit::conf website](https://posit.co/conference/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} for the dates and location of next year\'s
    conference and [keep an eye on
    EARL](https://earl-conference.com/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} for news on their next instalment. Also a
    chance to shout out [Jumping Rivers\' very helpful list of R
    conferences.](https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/events.html){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}

-   **Fun fact: **did you know that the result of your last executed R
    expression is saved to an internal value? This can come in handy
    when you forget to assign the result of a long-running function.
