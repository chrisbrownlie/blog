Happy Friday everyone! Some more news from the world of R this week:

-   **Astronomical docs: **R-universe have been accepted as a [Google
    Season of Docs 2024
    project](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}. This means they have secured funding to
    supercharge their documentation, including developing a new Quarto
    site to help people get started. As a fan of R-universe and ROpenSci
    I can't wait to see what Maëlle and the team come up with. See
    [their proposal
    here](https://github.com/r-universe-org/gsod-2024/wiki/GSOD-2024-proposal:-Documenting-R-software-publication-with-R%E2%80%90universe){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}.

-   **Polars bears:** the {polars} R package [has had a new
    release,](https://github.com/pola-rs/r-polars/releases/tag/v0.16.0){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} which comes with a lot of refactoring and
    renaming to bring it more in line with its Python equivalent. If you
    don't know it,
    [{polars}](https://rpolars.github.io/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} is a package written in Rust with a
    Python-like syntax for fast, efficient data manipulation.

-   **Cloud goddess:  **Thomas Sandmann has [written an interesting blog
    post](https://tomsing1.github.io/blog/posts/athena/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} about his experience of interacting with
    AWS S3 storage and the AWS Athena service using the {paws} and
    {noctua} R packages respectively.

-   **Tables and chairs:  **Posit have [announced the start of their
    2024 Table
    Contest](https://posit.co/blog/announcing-the-2024-table-contest/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}. Between now and the deadline of 31st May,
    R and Python developers will be creating many beautiful, useful,
    informative tables - if you work with tables or data visualisation
    I'd encourage you to think about submitting too!

-   **More learning:** ShinyConf finishes today and if you're in the
    mood for more and based in London, [check out
    SatRdays](https://satrdays-london-2024.jumpingrivers.com/#schedule){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} next Saturday 27th. One talk that I think
    looks very interesting is Charlie Gao talking about using {mirai} in
    Shiny and Plumber applications.

-   **Fun fact:** every R version since 2011 has been [named after a
    reference from the Peanuts comic
    strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"}. See
    [here](https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1980/06/29){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} for the origin of the name for R 4.3.3
    (Angel Food Cake).

### New package versions:

-   [{reticulate}
    1.36.0](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/news/index.html){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - lots of bug fixes and updated default
    Python version.

-   [{bagyo} 0.1.1](https://panukatan.io/bagyo/){target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"} - first CRAN release of a new data package
    containing tropical cyclone data, useful for demo visualisations.
